Superman,"Superman is an American fictional character, a comic book superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics. He is widely considered a national cultural icon. Superman was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, high school students living in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1933; the character was sold to Detective Comics, Inc. in 1938. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, television programs, films, newspaper strips, and video games. With the success of his adventures, Superman helped to create the superhero genre and establish its primacy within the American comic book.
Supermans appearance is distinctive and iconic. He usually wears a blue costume, red cape, and stylized red-and-yellow S shield on his chest. This shield is used in a myriad of media to symbolize the character.
The origin story of Superman relates that he was born Kal-El on the planet Krypton, before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Kryptons destruction. Discovered and adopted by a Kansas farmer and his wife, the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early he started to display superhuman abilities, which upon reaching maturity, he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity. Superman resides and operates in the fictional American city of Metropolis. As Clark Kent, he is a journalist for a Metropolis newspaper called the Daily Planet."
Spider-Man,"Spider-Man is a fictional character, a comic book superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crimefighter. Spider-Mans creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention which he called web-shooters, and react to danger quickly with his spider-sense, enabling him to combat his foes.
When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a teenage high school student and person behind Spider-Mans secret identity to whose self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness young readers could relate. Unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man did not benefit from being the protégé of any adult superhero mentors like Captain America and Batman, and thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story, but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben."
Hulk,"The Incredible Hulk is an ongoing comic book series featuring the Marvel Comics superhero the Hulk and his alter ego Dr. Bruce Banner.

Wolverine,"Wolverine is a fictional character, a superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. Born James Howlett and commonly known as Logan, Wolverine is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound, disease, or toxin at an accelerated rate.

Wolverine later joined the X-Mens All New, All Different roster in Giant-Size X-Men #1. X-Men writer Chris Claremont played a significant role in the characters subsequent development, along with artist/writer John Byrne, who insisted on making the character older than the other X-Men. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December 1982 in which Wolverines catchphrase, Im the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isnt very nice, debuted."

The character was created by Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger and Bob Kane, and first appeared in Batman #1. As the archenemy of the superhero Batman, the Joker has subsequently appeared in television programs, films, games, and on a variety of merchandise. The credit for creating the character is disputed, with both Kane and Robinson claiming responsibility for the Jokers design, but acknowledging Fingers writing contribution.
Throughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a highly intelligent, master criminal. Originally introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to the regulation of the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots in the early 1970s. As Batmans nemesis, Joker has been a part of many of the defining stories of that character, including the paralysis of his Batmans ally Batgirl, and the murder of Jason Todd, Batmans ward and the second Robin. Throughout the Jokers long history, there have been several different origin tales, but the most common has falling into a tank of chemical waste, which bleaches his skin white and turns his hair green and his lips bright red. He has been repeatedly analyzed by critics as the perfect adversary for Batman; their long, dynamic relationship often parallels the concept of yin and yang."
"Judge Dredd","Judge Joseph Dredd is a fictional character whose comic strip in the British science fiction anthology 2000 AD is the magazines longest running, having been featured there since its second issue in 1977. Dredd is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges combine the powers of police, judge, jury and executioner.

Although Daredevil had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists — Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita, Sr., and Gene Colan, among others — Frank Millers influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s is particularly remembered, having cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the Marvel Universe.

"Lex Luthor","Alexander Joseph Lex Luthor is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics.

Admirers praise the force of Trudeaus intellect and salute his political acumen in preserving national unity against the Quebec sovereignty movement, suppressing a violent revolt, and establishing the Charter of Rights and Freedoms within Canadas constitution. Critics accuse him of arrogance, economic mismanagement, and unduly favouring the federal government relative to the provinces, especially in trying to distribute the oil wealth of the Prairies."

Thus far, four different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of super-speed—have assumed the identity of the Flash: Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West, and Bart Allen. Before Wally and Barts ascension to the mantle of the Flash, they were both Flash protégés under the same name Kid Flash.
The second incarnation of the Flash, Barry Allen, is generally considered the first hero of the Silver Age of comic books and the superhero has remained one of DCs most popular ever since.

His role in comics has varied from supervillain to antihero to superhero.

"Flash Gordon","Flash Gordon is the hero of a science fiction adventure comic strip originally drawn by Alex Raymond. First published January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by and created to compete with the already established Buck Rogers adventure strip. Also inspired by these series were comics such as Dash Dixon by H.T. Elmo and Larry Antoinette and Don Dixon and the Hidden Empire by Carl Pfeufer and Bob Moore.
In Australia, the character and strip were retitled Speed Gordon to avoid a negative connotation of the word Flash. At the time, the predominant meaning of flash was showy, connoting dishonesty. In France, his adventures were published in Le Journal de Mickey, under the name Guy lÉclair. Dale Arden was named Camille in the French translation. In Spain, Mexico and some countries in Latin America, the strip is called Roldán el Temerario.
The Flash Gordon comic strip has been translated into a wide variety of media, including motion pictures, television and animated series.

He was discovered by the Allied Forces; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. In time Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned demon with a tail, horns, cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone. He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted peanuts. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to demons, has a strong sense of humor and works with other strange creatures in the BPRD. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy."
"Captain Marvel","Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam, is a fictional comic book superhero, originally published by Fawcett Comics and later by DC Comics. Created in 1939 by artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker, the character first appeared in Whiz Comics #2.

Several friends and family members, most notably Marvel Family cohorts Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr., can share Billys power and become Marvels themselves.
Hailed as The Worlds Mightiest Mortal in his adventures, Captain Marvel was nicknamed The Big Red Cheese by arch-villain Doctor Sivana, an epithet later adopted by Captain Marvels fans. Based on sales, Captain Marvel was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, as his Captain Marvel Adventures comic book series sold more copies than Superman and the other competing books of the time.

However, Dent goes insane after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him during a trial, hideously scarring the left side of his face. Dent adopts the Two-Face persona and becomes a criminal, choosing to bring about good or evil based upon the outcome of a coin flip. Originally, Two-Face was one of many gimmick-focused comic book villains, plotting crimes based around the number two, such as robbing Gotham Second National Bank at 2:00 on February 2.
In his autobiography, Batman creator Bob Kane claims to have been inspired by Robert Louis Stevensons Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, specifically the 1931 film version which he saw as a boy. Some inspiration was also derived from the pulp magazine character the Black Bat, whose origin story included having acid splashed in his face. In later years, writers have portrayed his obsession with duality and fate as the result of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and multiple personality disorder. He obsessively makes all important decisions by flipping a two-headed coin, one side scratched over with an X. The modern version is established as having once been a personal friend and ally of Commissioner James Gordon and Batman."

Lois Lanes character was created from many influences. Her physical appearance was originally based on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

During the Silver Age, she was the star of Supermans Girl Friend, Lois Lane, a comic title that had a light and frivolous tone. However, the original Golden Age version of Lois, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails journalist and intellectual equal to Superman.

Naruto appears in the series films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations.
When creating Naruto in the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character simple and stupid, while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto added a harsh past to give him a side of darkness. Many times he has revised narutos image, providing the character with different clothes to appeal to Western audiences and make him easier to illustrate.

Sasuke has additionally appeared in several of the featured movies in the series, as well as several other media relating to the series, including several video games and OVAs.
He was created as a rival and foil to the series titular character, Naruto Uzumaki.

Several anime and manga publications have provided acclaim and criticism of Sasukes character.

Later stories, published during the Silver Age of Comic Books, depicted the Black Canary as a world-class martial artist with a superpower — the Canary Cry — a high powered sonic scream that could shatter objects and incapacitate enemies.

The character first appeared in Adventure into Fear #19 and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, anthropomorphic, funny animal trapped on human-dominated Earth. Howards adventures are generally social satires, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafictional awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: that lifes most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter Gloria Katz, who in adapting the comic to the screen declared, Its a film about a duck from outer space... Its not supposed to be an existential experience."

According to writer Scott Lobdell, after the continuity changes after the DC Comics relaunch, it was said that Tim Drake never took up the Robin mantle officially, but rather was Batmans sidekick under the name Red Robin.

"Clark Kent","Clark Kent is an American fictional character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Appearing regularly in stories published by DC Comics, he debuted in Action Comics #1 and serves as the civilian and secret identity of the superhero Superman.
Over the decades there has been considerable debate as to which personality the character identifies with most. From his first introduction in 1938 to the mid-1980s, Clark Kent was seen mostly as a disguise for Superman, enabling him to mix with ordinary people. This was the view in most comics and other media such as TV and radio. In 1986, during John Byrnes revamping of the character, the emphasis was on Superman being the manufactured persona of Clark Kent, the side of the character he most identifies with. Different takes persist in the present."

Superboy-Prime,"Superboy-Prime, also known as Superman-Prime, or simply Prime, is a DC Comics superhero turned supervillain, and one of several alternate Supermen. The character first appeared in DC Comics Presents #87, and was created by Elliot S! Maggin and Curt Swan.

Over time, his convictions and morals became warped and as such, Prime still harbors a strong belief that becoming Superman is his calling despite the fact that he has become a psychotic and very dangerous villain who is one of the most dangerous villains that Superman and the rest of the superheroes have ever encountered due to Primes sheer ruthlessness and thirst for destruction as he seeks to pursue his destiny."

When DC Comics rewrote much of its continuity in 1986, Supermans history was changed so that he never took a costumed identity until adulthood, erasing Superboy from the canonical history of Superman, although many aspects of the backstory created in Superboy comics, such as Clarks friendship with Lana Lang, remained. In the last few years, some additional features of Superboys history, such as his tenure in the Legion, have also been reintroduced into the story of Supermans youth."

Alfred is a vital part of the Batman mythos, and appears in most other media adaptations of the character.

Both were also members of the 1990s-era Pentagon-sponsored mutant team X-Factor. After X-Factor disbanded, Havok starred in Mutant X, a series in which he explored a strange alternate reality. He has since returned to the X-Men, later taking over his fathers role as leader of the Starjammers to bring Vulcans reign over the Shiar to an end.

The identity of Batwoman is shared by two heroines in mainstream DC publications; both women are named Katherine Kane, with the original Batwoman commonly referred to by her nickname Kathy and the modern incarnation going by the name Kate.
Batwoman was created by Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff with writer Edmond Hamilton under the direction of editor Jack Schiff, as part of an ongoing effort to expand Batmans cast of supporting characters. Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics #233, in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman in order to combat the allegations of Batmans homosexuality arising from the controversial book Seduction of the Innocent. When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman-related comic books in 1964, he removed non-essential characters including Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Bat-Hound. Later, the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman had never existed, though her alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally."

Sakura initially has an infatuation for Sasuke, praising him at every juncture, and heaping scorn upon the less skilled Naruto. Over the course of the series, she begins to shed this singularly driven persona, and grows more appreciative and accepting of Naruto. Sakura has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including the four feature films in the series, all of the original video animations, and several video games.
Sakura has become the series female lead, although she was not immediately intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty in drawing her, resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.
Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Sakuras character. She was initially noted to be a stereotypical shōnen character, serving as a love interest for the protagonist, and served little purpose in the series initially beyond being comic relief. Her emergence from this stereotype as the series progressed, however, has been celebrated by reviewers. Amongst the Naruto reader base, Sakura has been popular, placing high in some polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Sakuras likeness, including a plush doll and key chains."

Other writers have portrayed him more humanly, as a humorously obnoxious yet caring boss who nevertheless has shown great bravery and integrity in the face of the assorted villains with which the Bugle comes into contact, and whose campaign against Spider-Man comes more from fear of youngsters following his example.

A mutant with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between Casablanca Records and Marvel Comics until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor Tom DeFalco and illustrator John Romita, Jr.
Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a disco singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including rock and adult contemporary. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early 1980s which lasted forty-two issues, a Marvel Graphic Novel titled Dazzler: The Movie, a four-issue limited series co-starring The Beast titled Beauty and the Beast, and later joined the cast of the X-Men. She was briefly a member of the spin-off group Excalibur but has since re-joined the X-Men. Dazzler was ranked 83rd in Comics Buyers Guides 100 Sexiest Women in Comics list."
